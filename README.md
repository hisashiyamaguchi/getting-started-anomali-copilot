Visit a sample security articles that has some IoCs(e.g. domain, IP, malware), and scan it with Copilot. I'm scanning [an article](https://www.govinfosecurity.com/japanese-businesses-hit-by-surge-in-ddos-attacks-a-27216) that tells us that majority Japanese financial sector customers have been impacted with huge DDoS attacks.

On my investigation, I can identify TTPs gaps that must be improved so that I can tacle this specific attack. For now, I don't have any defense capabilities that could be suitable with the TTPs!
